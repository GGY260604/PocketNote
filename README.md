# PocketNote 📒💰

PocketNote is a modern offline-first personal finance recorder built with Flutter and Firebase.  
It integrates Google AI (Gemini) to assist users in recording expenses and income via text and receipt recognition.

---

# 🌐 Google Developer Technologies Used

PocketNote is built using the following Google technologies:

- **Flutter** – Cross-platform UI framework (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop ready)
- **Firebase Authentication** – Anonymous + Google Sign-In
- **Cloud Firestore** – Cloud data synchronization
- **Firebase AI (Gemini API)** – AI parsing engine
- **Google ML Kit (Text Recognition)** – OCR for receipt processing

---

# 🤖 Google AI Technology Used

## Gemini API (via Firebase AI)

Gemini is used to intelligently parse:

- Natural language expense input  
  Example:  
  `spend 12.5 lunch`
- Income statements  
  Example:  
  `income 300 salary`
- Transfer operations  
  Example:  
  `transfer 50 fee 1.2`
- Receipt images (OCR + AI extraction)

---

# 🧠 Where AI Is Implemented in PocketNote

AI is integrated in:

### 1️⃣ Chat Page
- Text-to-structured record parsing
- AI candidate suggestion (multiple possible drafts)
- Smart fallback parser when AI unavailable

### 2️⃣ Receipt Flow
- Image → OCR (Google ML Kit)
- OCR text → Gemini structured draft extraction
- Multiple candidate selection before saving

AI never directly writes to database.  
User confirmation is required before record persistence.

# 🌍 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

PocketNote contributes to:

### SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth
Encourages responsible financial tracking and literacy.

### SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
Implements AI-driven finance tools.

### SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production
Promotes awareness of spending habits and budgeting.

### SDG 13 – Climate Action (Indirect)
Encourages reduced unnecessary consumption through awareness.

# 🏗 Technical Architecture

PocketNote follows a **layered offline-first architecture**:

```text
UI Layer (Pages / Widgets)
↓
State Layer (ChangeNotifier Providers)
↓
Repository Layer
↓
Local Storage (Hive)
↓
Cloud Sync (Firestore)
```

## State Management
- `Provider` (ChangeNotifier-based architecture)
- Separation between UI logic and data logic
- Clear unidirectional data flow

## Data Strategy
- Offline-first with Hive
- Firestore sync on authenticated login
- Soft-delete pattern for conflict resolution
- SyncGate mechanism to control one-time sync per UID

## Security Strategy
- Firestore security rules
- Authentication required for cloud operations

---

# 🚧 Challenges Faced

## 1️⃣ Dynamic Icon Tree-Shaking Issue
Flutter release build failed due to dynamic `IconData` instantiation.  
Solution:
- Disabled icon tree shaking using:

```code
--no-tree-shake-icons
```

---

## 2️⃣ R8 Release Build Failure (ML Kit)
Release builds failed due to missing ML Kit language classes.

Solution:
- Disabled R8 minification:

```code
isMinifyEnabled = false
isShrinkResources = false
```

---

## 3️⃣ Firestore Sync UI Not Updating
Data synced but UI did not refresh until month changed.

Root cause:
- Providers not refreshing after sync.

Solution:
- Explicit provider reload after sync completion.

---

## 4️⃣ BuildContext Async Gap Warnings
Resolved by:
- Capturing providers before await
- Guarding with `if (!mounted) return`

---

## 5️⃣ Multi-device Sync Conflict Risk
Implemented:
- Soft delete
- Timestamp updates
- Explicit month reload logic

---

# 🔮 Future Roadmap

## Phase 1 – Stability & Security
- Enable ProGuard with proper ML Kit keep rules
- Improve sync conflict resolution
- Background sync optimization
- Strengthen Firestore rules

## Phase 2 – AI Enhancement
- Auto-categorization model training
- AI budgeting suggestions
- Spending anomaly detection
- Smart financial insights dashboard

## Phase 3 – UX Improvements
- Advanced analytics (pie, trend, comparison)
- Export to CSV / PDF
- Dark mode polish
- Custom icon picker expansion

## Phase 4 – Production Readiness
- Play Store AAB publishing
- CI/CD pipeline
- Crashlytics integration
- Performance profiling
